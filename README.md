# [PetPlantsProject](https://wfanni.github.io/PetPlantsProject.github.io/)

This was my first bigger solo project, it is still work in progress in my free time.

Since the pandemic I got interested in indoor plants and well, plants in general. So little by little I collected quite a lot of plants in my home. I thought it would be nice to be able to sell the ones that don't have a space for in my home anymore, so I started to develop a website that maybe in the future could be a personal "plant webshop".

Due to the intense frontend course I was involved in, I had to postpone this project, but I'm planning to get back to it and update it with the knowledge I have now.

Thanks for reading!
